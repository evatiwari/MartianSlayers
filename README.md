## Getting started as a contributor
Before working on this project, make sure you have Node.js and NPM installed in your system. Once that is done, change directory
to the project directory, and in the command line, type 
```
npm install
```
to run the server, to install all dependencies. Once that is done, type
```
node app.js
```
to run the server. Since the server needs to be restarted everytime a change is made, it is suggested that one should use ```nodemon``` instead. 
To install nodemon, type
```
npm install -g nodemon
```
so that nodemon is installed and set as a path variable. Now, to start the server, simply type
```
nodemon
```
in the command line. This package restarts the server automatically everytime changes are made. 

### Happy Developing!
